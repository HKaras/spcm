1_dds_single_static_carrier.py

Single static carrier - This example shows the DDS functionality with 1 carrier with a fixed frequency and fixed amplitude

Example for analog replay cards (AWG) for the the M4i and M4x card-families with installed DDS option.

See the README file in the parent folder of this examples directory for information about how to use this example.
